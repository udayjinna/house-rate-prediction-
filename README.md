# House Rate Prediction 🏡

This project predicts house prices using various features such as location, square footage, number of bathrooms, and BHK (bedroom, hall, kitchen) count. It uses a cleaned dataset and a trained machine learning model to estimate property prices with high accuracy.

## 📊 Features Used

- Location  
- Total Square Footage  
- Number of Bathrooms  
- BHK (Bedrooms)

These features were selected based on their correlation with house price trends and availability in the dataset.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas & NumPy – data manipulation  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization  
- Scikit-learn – model building  
- Jupyter Notebook – development and experimentation

---

## 📈 Model Used

- Linear Regression was used due to its simplicity and efficiency for regression tasks.  
- GridSearchCV and cross-validation were applied to fine-tune the model and evaluate its performance.

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values  
- Removing outliers  
- Standardizing square footage per BHK  
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables (e.g., location)
